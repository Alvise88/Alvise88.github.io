In Swarm, however, a “service” means something completely different.
A Swarm service is the equivalent of a container and all of the information needed to instantiate and run it.
For example:
version: &amp;#39;3&amp;#39; networks: default: external: false services: whoami: image: traefik/whoami networks: - default deploy: replicas: 3There are two types of Swarm services.</description></item><item><title>Twelve Factor App</title><link>https://Alvise88.github.io/posts/twelve-factor-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 08:06:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Alvise88.github.io/posts/twelve-factor-app/</guid><description>The Twelve-Factor methodology is a set of twelve best practices to develop applications developed to run as a service.
This was originally drafted by Heroku for applications deployed as services on their cloud platform, back in 2011.
Over time, this has proved to be generic enough for any software-as-a-service (SaaS) development.
Docker ecosystem is awesome for developing twelve-factor apps.
Container images offer a contract with the operating system that can be effectively identical between your development environment and production environment.</description></item></channel></rss>
